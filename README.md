## Features

Large Language Models (LLMs) based AI bots are amazing. However, their behavior can be random and different bots excel at different tasks. If you want the best experience, don't try them one by one. ChatALL (Chinese name: ÈΩêÂè®) can send prompt to several AI bots concurrently, help you to discover the best results. All you need to do is [download, install](https://github.com/sunner/ChatALL/releases) and ask.

### Is this you?

Typical users of ChatALL are:

- ü§†**Gurus of LLMs**, who want to find the best answers or creations from LLMs.
- ü§ì**Researchers of LLMs**, who want to intuitively compare the strengths and weaknesses of various LLMs in different fields.
- üòé**Developers of LLM applications**, who want to quickly debug prompts and find the best-performing foundation models.

## Privacy

All chat history, settings and login data are saved locally on your computer.

ChatALL collects anonymous usage data to help us improve the product. Including:

- Which AI bots are prompted and how long the prompt is. Not including the prompt content.
- How long the response is, and which response is deleted/highlighted. Not including the response content.

## Prerequisites

ChatALL is a client, not a proxy. Therefore, you must:

1. Have working accounts and/or API tokens for the bots.
2. Have reliable network connections to the bots.

## Download / Install

Download from https://github.com/sunner/ChatALL/releases

### On Windows

Just download the \*-win.exe file and proceed with the setup.

### On macOS

For Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2 CPU), download the \*-mac-arm64.dmg file.

For other Macs, download \*-mac-x64.dmg file.

If you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can also install it with:

```bash
brew install --cask chatall
```

### On Linux

Debian-based Distributions: Download the .deb file, double click it and install the software.
Arch-based Distributions: You can clone ChatALL from the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chatall-bin). You can install it manually or using an AUR helper like yay or paru.
Other Distributions: Download the .AppImage file, make it executable, and enjoy the click-to-run experience. You can also use [AppimageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems while using ChatALL, you can try the following methods to resolve them:

1. **Refresh** - press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.
2. **Restart** - exit ChatALL and run it again.
3. **Re-login** - click the settings button in the upper right corner, then click the corresponding login/logout link to relogin the website.
4. **Create a new chat** - click the `New Chat` button and send prompt again.

If none of the above methods work, you can try **resetting ChatALL**. Note that this will delete all your settings and message history.

You can reset ChatALL by deleting the following directories:

- Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\chatall\`
- Linux: `/home/<user>/.config/chatall/`
- macOS: `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/chatall/`
